I decided to try out what all the hype was about and spent a few days learning Rust over spring break. I then decided to do a project that would bring me out of my comfort zone by working on a graphical simulation with no graphics or simulation programming background, while also reinforcing some the basic concepts of rust.
<div style={{"margin-top": "50px", "margin-bottom": "50px", "display": "flex", "justify-content": "center"}}>

</div>

## How to run
